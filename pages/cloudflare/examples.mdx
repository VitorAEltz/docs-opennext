## Examples

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Cloudflare using `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, run:

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next --experimental
```

### Basic starter projects

Basic example apps are included in the repository for `@opennextjs/cloudflare` package:

- [*`create-next-app`*](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/tree/main/examples/create-next-app) — a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
- [*`api`*](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/tree/main/examples/api) — a minimal Next.js project with a single API route
- [*`middleware`*](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/tree/main/examples/middleware) — a minimal Next.js project using middleware
- [*`vercel-blog-starter`*](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/tree/main/examples/vercel-blog-starter) — a blog project using SSG

You can use these to understand how to configure your Next.js app to use `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, or refer to [Get Started](/cloudflare/get-started).
