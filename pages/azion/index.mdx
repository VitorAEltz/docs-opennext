## Azion

The [`@opennextjs/azion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/azion) adapter lets you deploy Next.js apps to [Azion Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-functions/) using the [Node.js "runtime" from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).

### Get Started

##### New apps

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Azion using `@opennextjs/azion`, run:

```
npm create azion@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next --platform=edge-functions
```

##### Existing Next.js apps

Follow the guide [here](/azion/get-started) to use [@opennextjs/azion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/azion) with an existing Next.js app.

### Supported Next.js runtimes

Next.js has [two "runtimes"](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) â€” "Edge" and "Node.js". When you use `@opennextjs/azion`, your app should use the Node.js runtime, which is more fully featured, and allows you to use the [Node.js APIs](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-functions/runtime/) that are provided by the Azion Edge Functions runtime.

This is an important difference from `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`, which only supports the "Edge" runtime. The Edge Runtime code in Next.js [intentionally constrains which APIs from Node.js can be used](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/build/webpack/plugins/middleware-plugin.ts#L820), and the "Edge" runtime does not support all Next.js features.

### Supported Next.js versions

All minor and patch versions of Next.js 15 and the latest minor of Next.js 14 are supported.

To help improve compatibility, we encourage you to [report bugs](https://github.com/aziontech/opennextjs-azion/issues) and contribute code!

### How `@opennextjs/azion` Works

The OpenNext Azion adapter works by taking the Next.js build output and transforming it, so that it can run in Azion Edge Functions.

When you add [@opennextjs/azion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/azion) as a dependency to your Next.js app, and then run `npx opennextjs-azion` the adapter first builds your app by running the `build` script in your `package.json`, and then transforms the build output to a format that you can run locally using [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/cli/), and deploy to Azion.

You can view the code for `@opennextjs/azion` [here](https://github.com/aziontech/opennextjs-azion/tree/main/packages/azion/src) to understand what it does under the hood.

### Note on Edge Function Size Limits

The size limit of an Azion Edge Function is 50 MiB. After building your function, the CLI will show both the original and compressed sizes:

```
Total Upload: 13833.20 KiB / gzip: 2295.89 KiB
```

Only the latter (compressed size) matters for [the Edge Function size limit](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-functions/limits/).
